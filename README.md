BTP

This repository implements facial expression recognizer. 

We generate lbp_feature.xml from here and later use it 
for predicting expression class. 

In directory Debug you should see subdirectories
1,2,3,4,5,6. That is where training data is stored.

Each directory contains positive samples for one of the 
six expressions that we are trying to detect.
